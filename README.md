# Stuff

A portion of Ruby re-usable code.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'stuff', github: 'vladfaust/stuff'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

## Usage

`require` the stuff you need, e.g. `require 'stuff/callable'`. The gem has no dependencies itself but utilizes code from some (check the files' first lines).
